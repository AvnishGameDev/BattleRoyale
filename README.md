# Battle Royale Prototype (Unreal Engine 4)

> ⚠️ **Note:** This was a learning project I built around 4 years ago while diving deep into Unreal Engine 4 and game development. It's not polished or production-ready, but it represented my early steps into multiplayer systems and large-scale gameplay logic.

## 🎮 Overview

This is a prototype Battle Royale game built using **Unreal Engine 4**. The goal was to understand the fundamentals of:

- Replication and multiplayer logic in UE4
- Basic game loop for a last-man-standing mechanic
- Level design for large open-world combat zones
- Weapon and item pickup systems
- Character movement, shooting mechanics, and health systems

While it’s far from perfect, this project was a big milestone in my game development journey.

## 🔧 Features

- ✅  Player spawning and elimination
- ✅  Shrinking safe zone
- ✅  Third-person shooting mechanics
- ✅  Loot pickup system
- ✅  Health and damage system
- ✅  Basic UI (HUD and health bar)

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How Unreal handles **multiplayer replication**
- Blueprint and C++ integration in gameplay logic
- Managing gameplay states and player elimination
- Basic map design and navigation for large-scale levels

## 🛠️ Built With

- **Unreal Engine 4.2x** (I don't remember the exact version)
- Default assets + free marketplace packs

## 📁 Project Status

This project is **archived** and won’t receive any updates. It remains as a reference of my early learning phase with UE4 and multiplayer game development.
